<h1>Practice Projects</h1>
<hr><p>These are example projects which were built along with a YouTube Series to solidify the understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>At present we have 4 projects.</p>
<p>1.Character Counter</p>
<p>2.Digital Clock</p>
<p>3.Multiplication App</p>
<p>4.Local Storage</p><h2>General Information</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Character Counter</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The character counter takes the input in the text area. The text area has a maxlength of 50 characters. As soon as the user starts typing in the text area the total characters typed is reflected and the total characters remaining are reflected.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Digital Clock
The digital clock shows the current time in the HH:MM:SS format. We use the Date().getHours() ,
Date().getMinutes(), and the Date().getSeconds() to get the current time.
Then we use the setTimeout() function to refresh the function every second so that the time is refreshed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiplication App
In the multiplication App, We first generate two random numbers using the Math.ceil(Math.random()*10) function.
We ask the user what the correct answer from the user is. The user inputs the answer and if the answer is correct the score is increased by 1 and if the score is answer is incorrect the score is decreased by 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local Storage
This task combines localstorage and form validation. We are given a form with all the different 	inputs mentioned.
Once the use clicks on Add details to local storage button, you need to do following thing.
1.We need to validate each input of the form
2. If any input is invalid, an appropriate message is shown in red color
3.If all inputs are valid, then add all the data which user has entered in the localstorage
4.View added details in an Anchor Tag On clicking the anchor tag, we should go to 2nd page.</p>
